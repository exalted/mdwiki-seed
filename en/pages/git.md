# Git and revision control

The github team profile contains (a few of) the ROS nodes that are on the rover now plus configuration files and scripts.
New project should create a new repository on behalf of the team profile and clone them to the rover.

Follow the classic branching model:

**master** branch contains stable, usable code
**develop** contains unstable, but compilable code during the testing process of new features.
other branch follow the development of a new feature
