# Learning

The work we do requires knowledge in many different fields. Here we put links to resources (videos, books and tutorials), many of which are freely available on the web. No one is required to learn all this stuff (it is not possible to do this in a short amount of time), but you can access to these resources when you want to go deep in a subject.

[C++](c++.md)
[python](python.md)
[Learning - Robotics](robotics_learning.md)
[Learning - Computer Vision](computer_vision_learning.md)
[Learning - Odometry and SLAM](odometry_and_slam_learning.md)
[Learning - Network Protocols](network_protocols_learning.md)
[Learning - Driver Development](driver_development_learning.md)
