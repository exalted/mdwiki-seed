# Ubuntu

Ubuntu is the first distro offically supported by ROS. All the tutorials on the wiki are made using Ubuntu so it is pretty ease to use it.

However Ubuntu does not update its packages really often, so many libraries, compilers and tools can be old and missing some interesting features.

If this is your first time at using linux, you should use ubuntu.

## Virtual Machine

For most task it is also possible to run ubuntu inside a VM. 
See [Ubuntu - VM](ubuntu_vm.md)

However this choice is discourage if you want to do heavy computation (e.g. 3D graphics). If you plan to use ubuntu for the hard stuff, install it natively

## Team Diana Repo

Many packages that we use every day are provided by our repo. See [Team Diana Repository](team_diana_ubuntu_repo.md)
